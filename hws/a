SICP is a literary masterpiece.  It's not often that you can say that
a technical book is a page-turner, but that's just what I found SICP
to be.  The book moves from topic to topic with rare ease and clarity,
but more importantly it moves with purpose and mission.  As you read
it, you can feel the authors slowly building a tension towards a climax.
The chapters fly by as you read about data structures, algorithms, message
passing, first-class procedures, and so much else.  Each concept leads
inevitably to the next.  Each chapter adds to the ever building tension.
By time you are half-way through the book, the sense that
something important is about to change becomes palpable.
