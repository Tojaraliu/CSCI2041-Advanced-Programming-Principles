And then something important changes!  Something you had not anticipated.
Something you should have guessed, but did not.  On page 216 they
introduce a concept so familiar that most programming books start
with it.  On page 216 they prove to you that you've had some wrong
ideas about programming all along.  On page two hundred and sixteen,
after talking about algorithms, data structures, recursion, iteration,
trees, high-order procedures, scoping, local variables, data abstraction,
closures, message-passing, and a plethora of other topics -- after all
that, they introduce assignment!  And with that elegant coup-de-grace
(which is not the last in this book!), they vanquish the concept that
programming is about manipulating state.  With that one stroke, they
force you to look back on all you had done in the previous pages in a
new and enlightened way -- a functional way.
