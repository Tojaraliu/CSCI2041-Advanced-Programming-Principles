Why is functional programming important?  Because Moore's law has started to falter.
Not the part of the law that predicts that the number of transistors on a chip doubles
every two years.  Thankfully, that part of the law seems to still be in effect.  The
part that faltered is the part that says the speed of computers doubles every two
years. 
What this means is that our computers can still get faster, but only if we put multiple
CPUs on a chip.  This is why we've seen all these multi-core processors showing up.
And that means that programs that need greater speed will have to be able to take
advantage of the multiple cores.
